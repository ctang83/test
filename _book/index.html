<li>why you want this particular job?
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>As a researcher in health systems, I prefer real-world experience, however I have experience in just a few countries, such as China and Australia, so I eager to get more working experience with different countries</li>
<li>I hope to gain more experiences in international comparison for health systems, which will benefit my research career in long-term.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>以前什么研究？I have broad research interests, my primary research interest is in examining human resources for health. In particular, my research concerns the way in which a developing country accumulating physician human capital. Specifically, my projects ask questions such as:
<ul>
<li>if there is multi-tiered medical education system in China?</li>
<li>if so, what are the long-term cost-benefits in implementing such an education and health system?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>my previous studies also detected the growth of private hospitals and their health workforce in China,</li>
<li>I like utilising novel techniques in studying health system, I am among the first group who brought about network science approach to analyse health service delivery, and characterising dynamics of a health system, I have two published papers in this interdisciplinary field</li>
<li>what value you will bring?

<li>Chinese government prefer top-down approach, generally overlook the bottom-up approach</li>
<li>lack of qualified primary care system, hospital-dominance health system, which is closely related to the multi-tiered medical education system which I have studied and published</li>
<li>it’s sometimes even worse to build an unsatisfied primary care system, which resulted in coordination issues</li>
</ul></li>
</ol></li>
