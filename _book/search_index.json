The East Asia Pacific Region (EAP) is a highly diverse region, with countries of all income levels and wide differences in resource endowments, human capital, and institutional capacity. The Health, Nutrition and Population Global (HNP) Practice in EAP has a large lending and ASA portfolio, with commitments worth $3.7 billion, and analytical and advisory activities under implementation. The Unit is actively engaged in most countries in the region, oftentimes at the subnational level. The EAP HNP strategy has as objective to improve HNP outcomes and make progress towards UHC and enhance the performance and resilience of health systems in financially affordable and sustainable ways. higher middle-income countries: rapid ageing of the population and consequent multi-morbidity of NCDs; the unfinished agenda with healthcare financing, purchasing and payment reforms; second generational service delivery reforms for better integration and coordination of care across all levels of healthcare. lower middle-income countries: universal and effective health coverage; equitable access to care and financial protection; the unfinished MDG agenda, (Goals 4, 5 and 6) and the consequent double burden of illness with the advent of NCDs and injuries as a result of demographic and epidemiologic transition. Pacific Island Countries(PICs) PICs comprise Fiji, Kiribati, the Marshall Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia, Nauru, Palau, Samoa, the Solomon Islands, Tonga, Tuvalu, and Vanuatu. PICs face unique developmental challenges! They are characterized by smallness in size, extreme remoteness, geographic dispersion, and a high vulnerability to natural disasters. Given this context, many of the health systems in the PICs face constraints with limited internal capacities to draw upon and high cost of service delivery while also having a high level of the Government commitment to meet the health needs of the population. There is significant development partner support to PICs, with the more recent focus on pandemic response and vaccination. The remoteness of the countries while an initial buffer against COVID pandemic, did not entirely protect the countries against outbreaks but did provide time to substantially vaccinate the populations. Still, there is a need to work on health resource prioritization and strengthen the health systems for the future health emergencies and progress towards national priorities of improved UHC. World Bank’s support to the Pacific Island Countries has grown recently. The Bank’s PICs health program will continue to have a country-focused and regional analytical and advisory program covering health resource prioritization, service delivery and resilience themes: strengthening health systems through a COVID-focused response or through broader public health and service delivery investments Pacific Islands Regional Oceanscape Program (PROP) The World Bank’s US$74 million Pacific Islands Regional Oceanscape Program is working with seven countries and one regional organization in an effort improve sustainable ocean-based livelihoods. Papua New Guinea Health outcomes in PNG remain poor despite several years of rapid economic growth. The population has low life-expectancy, one of the lowest global rates of immunization and highest rates of child stunting, and an increasing incidence of infectious disease such as multi-drug resistant tuberculosis. PNG has been hit by COVID outbreaks and has faced difficulty in vaccinating its population. PNG faces serious challenges in its quest to improve its financing and delivery of essential health services – either through government or church-provided providers – though the new National Health Plan (2021-2030), launched in December 2021 makes a serious commitment to improving population’s access to and quality of health services. The PNG HNP portfolio includes a suite of lending and analytical activities focused on key priorities in the health sector, anchored by a multi-year program of health sector performance analysis, policy dialogue and capacity building focused on prioritizing health resources, service delivery bottlenecks and nutrition. There are also three investment projects that are being implemented by the National Department of Health. IMPACT Health that supports improvement of essential health service delivery and strengthening of provincial health systems; Emergency Tuberculosis Project (ETP); PNG COVID-19 Emergency Response Project. A Child Nutrition and Social Protection Project, an investment project focused on improving child nutrition and building social protection systems in PNG, is currently being prepared. 3.8 Health system knowledge Health system strengthening It is structured around the WHO framework that describes health systems in terms of six core components or “building blocks”: health workforce, financing financing and the health workforce are key input components to the health system service delivery, access to essential medicines, service delivery and medical products and technologies, reflects the outputs of the health system, i.e. the availability and distribution of care leadership/governance health information systems leadership/governance and health information systems, provide the basis for the overall policy and regulation of all the other health system blocks Health financing Health financing is a core function of health systems that can enable progress towards universal health coverage by improving effective service coverage and financial protection.

The WBG’s Health, Nutrition and Population Global Practice provides financing, state-of-the-art analysis, and policy advice to help countries expand access to quality, affordable health care. It also prioritizes protecting people from falling into poverty or becoming poorer due to illness; and promoting investments in all sectors that form the foundation of healthy societies. The central contribution of the HNP Global Practice to the World Bank’s twin goals is to enable the achievement of Universal Health Coverage (UHC), in which all people are effectively covered by essential health services, and nobody suffers undue financial hardship as a result of illnesses. In the quest for UHC, the HNP Global Practice is building on progress made in the framework of the Millennium Development Goals, an array of analytical and advisory services, strategic partnerships with partner institutions and other financing agencies, and an active lending portfolio. The HNP Global Practice includes staff members in Washington, DC and many country offices. The HNP Global Practice Leadership Team, which leads and manages the HNP GP, consists of the Senior Director, the Director, eight HNP Practice Managers and six Global Leads (for Financing; Healthy Societies; Nutrition; Population and Development; Decision and Delivery Science; and Service Delivery).
