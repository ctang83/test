We initially plan to visit MQ, after the arrival, my family decided to stay here because my two kids enjoyed their new school, and because of the recent lockdown in China. Recently, I moved on to work as a research fellow at MUCHE - …, however it is a short-term contract with one-year period, this is a transitional position for me Why NU? My previous research focuses on health system and policy in China，while I have strong interests in developing countries, especially post-communist countries and their health system reform.

In particular, my research concerns the way in which a developing country accumulating physician human capital. Specifically, my projects ask questions such as: I first raised the research question whether there is multi-tiered medical education system in China? If so, what are the long-term cost-benefits in implementing such an education and health system? What is the important contribution of your research? Why is [specific phenomenon I research] important? my previous studies also detected the growth of private hospitals and their health workforce in China, With expertise and knowledge in medical education and health workforce, I will propose a solution in strengthening health system in developing countries: accumulation of physician human capital I am an advocate for workflow integration and automation, I use GitHub, Online Dashboard, and markdown, I will join World Bank GitHub group using a coding-style management I am a Chinese native speaker, familiar with China’s experience and development Chinese government prefer top-down approach, generally overlook the bottom-up approach lack of qualified primary care system, hospital-dominance health system, which is closely related to the multi-tiered medical education system which I have studied and published it’s sometimes even worse to build an unsatisfied primary care system, which resulted in coordination issues What are your research plans? Why are you interested in this job? A trick is adding a line to pick their interest. Something along these lines: “I would also see myself creating a research group on X. If you are interested, I could elaborate on this” As a researcher in health systems, I prefer real-world experience, however I have experience in just a few countries, such as China and Australia, I eager to get more working experience with different countries I hope to gain more experiences in international comparison for health systems, which will benefit my research career in long-term.

Speech draft Good afternoon, everyone. I am honored to be here today to speak to you about my research in the field of public policy. As an associate professor in this field, my work focuses on examining the intersection of policy and politics. I am particularly interested in how policy decisions are made and how they impact the lives of ordinary people. Over the last several years, I have conducted research on a range of topics including campaign finance, healthcare policy, and education reform. One of my key contributions to the field has been to use quantitative methods to study the effects of policy on a wide range of outcomes, including economic growth, health outcomes, and educational achievement. In my most recent work, I have focused on the impact of campaign finance on political polarization. My findings suggest that the increasing role of money in politics has led to a more divided political landscape, with politicians becoming more entrenched in their positions and less willing to compromise. In addition to my research, I am also committed to teaching and mentoring students. I have taught a variety of courses at the undergraduate and graduate levels, including introductory courses on public policy and more specialized seminars on campaign finance and healthcare policy. I am passionate about helping students develop the skills and knowledge they need to succeed in the field of public policy. I am excited to continue this line of research and to contribute to the growing body of knowledge on the effects of public policy on society. Thank you for the opportunity to speak with you today. I would be happy to take any questions you may have.

The issue here is not whether transition economics should continue their reform process or not, since this has been historically proven necessary for the development of a country. Rather, it is about what the government can do to alleviate health problems through the adoption and implementation of sound policies. Since the health of a nation is strongly dependent on social, economic, and political stability sound health policies have to go hand in hand with adequate economic policies and a set of measures to ensure a social safety net to protect the relatively deprived. Understand how policy and social factors shape health outcomes. Combining a strong foundation in policy with social justice principles, students learn to analyse local and global health systems, the layered social, cultural and environmental determinants of health, and craft policies to achieve socially just health outcomes.
