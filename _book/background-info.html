<li>Health policies in transition economics
<ul>
<li>Historical evidence indicates that economic transformation, even with access and growth, can translate into social insecurities and health problems. The issue here is not whether transition economics should continue their reform process or not, since this has been historically proven necessary for the development of a country. Rather, it is about what the government can do to alleviate health problems through the adoption and implementation of sound policies. Since the health of a nation is strongly dependent on social, economic, and political stability sound health policies have to go hand in hand with adequate economic policies and a set of measures to ensure a social safety net to protect the relatively deprived.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Understand how policy and social factors shape health outcomes. Combining a strong foundation in policy with social justice principles, students learn to analyse local and global health systems, the layered social, cultural and environmental determinants of health, and craft policies to achieve socially just health outcomes.

## World Bank-Cover letter

I am writing to apply for the Senior Health Economist position at The World Bank Group. 
For over ten years, I have worked as a researcher and educator in health administration and economics in both the academic and public sectors. 
My academic background, a Ph.D. in Economics from the University of New South Wales and a Master's degree in Social Medicine & Health Administration from Fujian Medical University, as well as my government experience, qualifies me for this post. 

My primary research interests lie in the areas of health systems, health workforce, and health economics. The major themes centre on understanding how a society, particularly a developing country, can grow and accumulate human capital in the health sector. Motivated by passion and curiosity, I have a proven track record in health system research, demonstrated by over twenty papers published by reputable peer-review journals, including *Health Policy and Planning*, *Health Systems & Reform*, *Human Resources for Health*, *Health Economics*, and *The Lancet(Abstr)*. Due to my outstanding research experience, I was selected to serve as an Associate Editor for the journal *BMC Medical Education* since 2019.

As a senior researcher focused on the real world, I also have extensive experience working with governments at both the provincial and national levels, especially based in East Asia and Pacific region. Prior to beginning my PhD program, I worked as a researcher in the Health Department of China and as an investigator of the health system and services. My multidisciplinary background, quantitative skills, and personal attributes equipped me to be an effective storyteller. For instance, I have broad experience in novel uses of data to disseminate information to students and other researchers. As a quantitative researcher, I believe that it has often been said that a picture paints a thousand words.

[East Asia Pacific](https://www.worldbank.org/en/region/eap)

1. comprises Cambodia, China, Indonesia, Lao People’s Democratic Republic (PDR),Malaysia, Mongolia, Myanmar, Papua New Guinea, the Philippines, Thailand, Timor-Leste (East Timor), Vietnam, and the Pacific Island Countries (Federated States of Micronesia, Kiribati, the Marshall Islands, New Caledonia, Palau, Solomon Islands, Tonga, Tuvalu, Vanuatu).
1. The East Asia Pacific Region (EAP) is a highly diverse region, with countries of all income levels and wide differences in resource endowments, human capital, and institutional capacity. 
1. The Health, Nutrition and Population Global (HNP) Practice in EAP has a large lending and ASA portfolio, with commitments worth $3.7 billion, and analytical and advisory activities under implementation. The Unit is actively engaged in most countries in the region, oftentimes at the subnational level. 
1. The EAP HNP strategy has as objective to improve HNP outcomes and make progress towards UHC and enhance the performance and resilience of health systems in financially affordable and sustainable ways.
1. higher middle-income countries: 
    1. rapid ageing of the population and consequent multi-morbidity of NCDs; 
    1. the unfinished agenda with healthcare financing, purchasing and payment reforms; 
    1. second generational service delivery reforms for better integration and coordination of care across all levels of healthcare. 
1. lower middle-income countries: 
    1. universal and effective health coverage; 
    1. equitable access to care and financial protection; 
    1. the unfinished MDG agenda, (Goals 4, 5 and 6) and the consequent double burden of illness with the advent of NCDs and injuries as a result of demographic and epidemiologic transition.

[Pacific Island Countries(PICs)](https://www.worldbank.org/en/country/pacificislands/overview#1)

1. PICs comprise Fiji, Kiribati, the Marshall Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia, Nauru, Palau, Samoa, the Solomon Islands, Tonga, Tuvalu, and Vanuatu.
1. PICs face unique developmental challenges! They are characterized by smallness in size, extreme remoteness, geographic dispersion, and a high vulnerability to natural disasters. Given this context, many of the health systems in the PICs face constraints with limited internal capacities to draw upon and high cost of service delivery while also having a high level of the Government commitment to meet the health needs of the population. 
1. There is significant development partner support to PICs, with the more recent focus on pandemic response and vaccination. The remoteness of the countries while an initial buffer against COVID pandemic, did not entirely protect the countries against outbreaks but did provide time to substantially vaccinate the populations. 
1. Still, there is a need to work on health resource prioritization and strengthen the health systems for the future health emergencies and progress towards national priorities of improved UHC. 
1. World Bank’s support to the Pacific Island Countries has grown recently. The Bank’s PICs health program will continue to have a country-focused and regional analytical and advisory program covering health resource prioritization, service delivery and resilience themes: `strengthening health systems through a COVID-focused response or through broader public health and service delivery investments`

1. Health outcomes in PNG remain poor despite several years of rapid economic growth. 
1. The population has low life-expectancy, one of the lowest global rates of immunization and highest rates of child stunting, and an increasing incidence of infectious disease such as multi-drug resistant tuberculosis. 
1. PNG has been hit by COVID outbreaks and has faced difficulty in vaccinating its population. 
1. PNG faces serious challenges in its quest to improve its financing and delivery of essential health services – either through government or church-provided providers – though the new National Health Plan (2021-2030), launched in December 2021 makes a serious commitment to improving population’s access to and quality of health services.

## Health system knowledge

[Health system strengthening](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_systems_strengthening)

It is structured around the WHO framework that describes health systems in terms of six core components or “building blocks”: 

1. health workforce, 
1. financing 
    - financing and the health workforce are key **input** components to the health system 
1. service delivery, 
1. access to essential medicines, 
    - service delivery and medical products and technologies, reflects the **outputs** of the health system, i.e. the availability and distribution of care
1. leadership/governance 
1. health information systems
    - leadership/governance and health information systems, provide the **basis** for the overall policy and regulation of all the other health system blocks

[Health financing](https://www.who.int/health-topics/health-financing#tab=tab_1)

Health financing is a core function of health systems that can enable progress towards universal health coverage by improving effective service coverage and financial protection. 

[Health service delivery](https://www.euro.who.int/en/health-topics/Health-systems/health-services-delivery)

A healthcare service delivery model is an approach to delivering healthcare. It's a series of services that include health services and support for the community, like education about preventive care and health promotion.
It has three major components: primary healthcare, health promotion and wellness, and caregiver education.

[UHC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_health_care)

Universal health care (also called universal health coverage, universal coverage, or universal care) is a health care system in which all residents of a particular country or region are assured access to health care.

resilience of health system

The health system need to develop capacities to cope with challenges from both certainty and uncertainty

## HNP-GP, WBG

[Health, Nutrition & Population Global Practice](https://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/health)

WBG supports countries’ efforts towards achieving Universal Health Coverage (UHC) and to provide quality, affordable health services to everyone —regardless of their ability to pay — by strengthening primary health care systems and reducing the financial risks associated with ill health and increasing equity. 

The WBG’s Health, Nutrition and Population Global Practice provides financing, state-of-the-art analysis, and policy advice to help countries expand access to quality, affordable health care. It also prioritizes protecting people from falling into poverty or becoming poorer due to illness; and promoting investments in all sectors that form the foundation of healthy societies.

The central contribution of the HNP Global Practice to the World Bank’s twin goals is to enable the achievement of Universal Health Coverage (UHC), in which all people are effectively covered by essential health services, and nobody suffers undue financial hardship as a result of illnesses. In the quest for UHC, the HNP Global Practice is building on progress made in the framework of the Millennium Development Goals, an array of analytical and advisory services, strategic partnerships with partner institutions and other financing agencies, and an active lending portfolio. 

The HNP Global Practice includes staff members in Washington, DC and many country offices. The HNP Global Practice Leadership Team, which leads and manages the HNP GP, consists of the Senior Director, the Director, eight HNP Practice Managers and six Global Leads (for Financing; Healthy Societies; Nutrition; Population and Development; Decision and Delivery Science; and Service Delivery).
