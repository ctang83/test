Health financing is a core function of health systems that can enable progress towards universal health coverage by improving effective service coverage and financial protection. 

[Health service delivery](https://www.euro.who.int/en/health-topics/Health-systems/health-services-delivery)

A healthcare service delivery model is an approach to delivering healthcare. It's a series of services that include health services and support for the community, like education about preventive care and health promotion.
It has three major components: primary healthcare, health promotion and wellness, and caregiver education.
