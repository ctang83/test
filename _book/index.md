# HKU speech

Dear Prof Lin, I am honored to do this job talk, titled “Complex Health System in Transition”, 
in applying for an assistant professor of health economics, policy and management at The University of Hong Kong.



So first of all, why do I apply for this academic job?


I will first put it in a big picture here, because it’s quite related to my recent experience and the main object of my research – the health systems in China.

When we looking at the outside, 
    - The Russia-Ukraine War has changed the whole geopolitics of Eurasia, including China mainland, and Hong Kong

When we looking at the inside, 
    - China finally lifted COVID restrictions, and there is one more point I don’t want to put on the slides is “China’s political changes”

HK has always been a bridge between the East and the West, I’m not sure whether the world is going to be more divided, 
    - however, The University of HK is such a best international platform, that can provide me to observe this historical change on the frontline. 


Then Let’s just go back to the title “complex health system in transition” 
-	The reason I use “Interdisciplinary” is that I want to describe my works in one word, and the object of my research, China’s health system

Second, as a practical health policy researcher, I am always looking for ways to utilise my knowledge and skills to the real-world situations. Here is my story of No-lockdown. 
-	For the past three years, my family and I have not been touched by any lockdown regulations. As we took a trip to Australia in January 2020 and avoided the pandemic breakout in Wuhan, which resulted in a statewide lockdown in China. 
-	We delayed our return trip to China until March, and after we back to Guangzhou, the COVID-19 outbreak had begun in Australia, resulting in two lockdowns afterwards. 
-	We were lucky as Guangzhou had no lockdowns from then until 2021. During that time, I applied for and was granted the Australian Global Talent Visa.  
-	In November 2021, Australia fully lifted restrictions, my family left China and immigrated to Sydney, where we have remained until now. So my family has not been locked for even one day. The three years of experience have seen a combination of good fortune and my careful judgement based on medical and geopolitical factors.

Beyond the practical application of knowledge, let’s go along with my research to demonstrate the interdisciplinary nature of complex health system



In order to study the health system, I have conducted a series of interdisciplinary research 
    along streams such as workforce, network science, and primary care, public health, population urbanisation, infrastructure development


Here is the first stream: the health workforce and medical education

I have a series of research papers about health workforce and medical education, they are published by top-field journals, such as Health Systems & Reform, Health Policy and Planning


I hope to highlight this paper titled “The multi-tiered medical education system and its influence on the health care market – China’s Flexner Report”, published by <Human Resources for Health>
-	This is a paper co-authored with the famous health economist Chee-Ruey Hsieh
-	This paper first documented China’s multi-tiered medical education system originated from the USSR, and demonstrated its trade-off between quantity and quality in training health care professionals. Many researchers told me that this paper solved their long-term puzzle about China’s health system because we linked both the healthcare market and the medical education market. 

More recently, I have a paper titled “Physician Human Capital, Access to and Mismatch of Health Care” just accepted for publication by <China Economic Quarterly>, which is a top-two Economics journal in China 



As you know, to some extent, China is like Australia, with big and concentrated urban areas, and lots of remote and rural areas
-	To guarantee the access to healthcare, the health workforce capability and distribution might be the biggest challenge to such a huge health system
-	That’s the reason I engage in this field 




Here is the second stream of my studies examining the complex health systems,
- it’s about network and organisation. I have a number of studies in this research field, as shown in the slide

Recently, the application of network science has been increasing rapidly
- this study titled “Do Chinese hospital services constitute an oligopoly? Evidence of the rich-club phenomenon in a patient referral network” is the first paper that applied network science in analysing healthcare market
- the paper has been published by an interdisciplinary journal <Future Generation Computer Systems>


In this paper, my research question is What do inpatients’ transfer-networks look like? 
- how can we measure the network features using topology? 

To answer that, we extracted two-years data from New Cooperation Medical Scheme (NCMS) in Fujian province

We built the patients’ transfer-network by first defining the node as a hospital, 
- Between two nodes, we define one edge or link, 
- if there are the same admissions for the individual patient within ten days, we draw a link between two nodes or hospitals



Through the topology estimation and network analysis
- we found the power-law degree distribution among top-hospitals and small hospitals
- we also found and featured a global rich-club phenomenon among top-hospitals

The findings indicate an oligopoly market in which top-hospitals occupy a dominant position. 
- our study first provides a network perspective in understanding a large-scale and complex health system

(btw, 64,076 referral flow data, covering 800 different diseases)


I also have been involved into primary care and public health research, which is the third stream in my past research
-	the studies have been published by top-field-journals in public health and global health, 
-	for example, American Journal of Public Health, and Journal of Global Health

I will briefly talk about the AJPH paper, 
- the whole project aims to assess the quality of primary health care using unannounced standardized patients (USPs) in China


In order to achieve SDG (sustainable development goals), UHC, especially quality healthcare is required
- however a review that included 80 studies in China concluded that the quality of both public and private health care providers was poor, 
- but the private sector performed slightly better in only some quality dimensions. 

The challenges facing developing countries, like China, are quality monitoring in healthcare, 
- however this is such a notorious difficulty in health services research


Therefore, a project titled “Primary heAlth Care quAlity Cohort In ChinA (ACACIA)” was launched 
-	we utilised a technique called Unannounced Standardized patients (USP) to assess PHC quality with a nationally representative sample of primary care providers in China
-	we presented innovative ways to build a resilient data collection system in this study


Ok, now, this is the last stream about my research in complex health system
-	China is famous for its infrastructure giant over last two decades, so we investigated how the population mobility and the development of infrastructure, like High-speed Railway, influence healthcare seeking behaviours. 
-	This paper is also published by the top-field journal HPP. 
-	In this paper, I am the co-first author with Prof Gordon Liu. 


The question is why high-speed railways and patients’ healthcare seeking behaviours are correlated? 

I will compare the infrastructure in China and Australia. 
- as we know, both China and Australia have big, concentrated urban areas, and lots of remote, rural areas

While these two countries developed different health infrastructure:
- For example, in the left picture, this is Chengdu East HSR station, we found Hospitals built next to the High-speed railway Station
- On the right picture, this is Royal Flying Doctor in Australia, I took this photo from the Tasmania Airport



This is a geographic graph of Sichuan province, 
-	as we can see, the yellow columns indicate the county population number, 
-	columns with other colour indicate the inpatients that is adjusted by the relative weight of DRGs

this picture shows an extremely unbalanced distribution of inpatients between capital city and other areas 
- This phenomenon gives us a clue that patients intended to congregate when HSR was developed. 



Focusing on the complex health system, all my research stemmed from my primary working experience in the Fujian Health Reform office over ten years ago 
-	since then, I tried to answer my question, for example, how to understand and profile the health systems, how to improve and strengthen the health systems
-	especially for those developing countries, they often face very different situations compared to their developed counterparts
-	more important, they are moving their economic equilibrium from status A to status B

Thus, my previous research provides an interdisciplinary example of investigating the complex health system embedded into the transitional background


Based on my solid research and publications, 
- I have applied and successfully obtained Young Scientists Fund of the National Natural Science Foundation of China, as the principal investigator.

I also got funding from the NHC key laboratory of Health Economics and Policy


I established my international expertise through academic activities over last decade
-	I have been working as the scientific committee for iHEA and Global Symposium on Health Systems Research 
-	I was also invited to join the BMC Medical Education as an Associate Editor

Finally, I reviewed manuscripts for lots of top journals, such as Lancet Public Health and Health Economics




Now, as a junior social scientist, I have a google h-index over 13 


In the last part, I want to talk about my future plan if there is a chance for me to work at The University of Hong Kong


Here are two working papers that I have almost prepared and ready to submit 

“The economic burden of medical disputes among hospitals” 

And “Does pandemic challenge attract more talents into healthcare? The “Fauci effect” in Medical Education” 


I had teaching experience in a couple of universities, like Southwestern Uni of Finance and Economics, Southern Medical University, as mentioned in my CV. 
- however I will brief three courses that I am keen to teach, and I think that may fit students of the School of Public Health

My mixed research skills and frameworks are from these courses 


This is the first course named “Microeconometrics” 
-	Essentially, this is an interdisciplinary field between economics and psychology

In specific, I will introduce the choice modelling and preference elicitation experiment in public policy and health services
-	including a series of survey-based experiments, like DCE, BWS, and CV


The second course is about macroeconomy and health, which perfectly fit students from the School of Public Health

The World Health Org has established the CMH, which is led by 18 world leading economists and scientists, and chaired by Jeffrey Sachs

In this course, I will focus on the relationships between economic growth and the health, and healthcare market, and the role of health economics


The last course I would like to introduce is Network Science
- A more familiar title for many audiences is “Social Network Analysis”, while it is just a small part of network science

As I have mentioned in the research part, I am among the first group who have applied this technique in health service research  
- I believe this course can not only provide us with a skill in analysing the complex health system
- but also gives us a system thinking approach and global perspective in interdisciplinary research 



This is the other network. The future research networks! 
- Within the University of Hong Kong, I hope to work with you. I think we share common research interests in the health system. Or I can work with A/Prof Karen Grepin in health economics. 

In addition, I have interest in building a collaboration with BIMHSE, as a newly established research institute, I think this is a research field the University of Hong Kong hopes to invest in. 

Besides, I have a long-term cooperation and connections with Prof Gordon Liu, who is the Dean of the Institute for Global Health and Development at the Peking University 
-	I have been hired as an adjunct fellow by the Professor Liu in the past four years



During the last six years in China, I have supervised three master students who are already graduated 

I also want to highlight an unusual educational experience with my son, 
 - he is a gifted child, he has gifts in geography and mathematics
 - as an 8 years old boy, he is currently self-studying Australian Year 11 math extension 1, the 3U math, which is a university prerequisite course in mathematics





Finally, I hope to summarise my qualifications and experience in health economics and policy

-	I have proven ability to produce quality research publications in high quality international journals, I worked as an Associate Editor of the international journal, and scientific committee members of top international conferences for a couple of years, I have also applied for and successfully obtained national funding as a Principle-investigator
-	I am also able to do undergraduate and postgraduate education and research; 
-	I have appropriate educational and supervision experience. 
-	I actively extended my network in knowledge exchange with different universities and countries. 

I believe I would be a good fit for the Division of Health Economics, Policy, and Management at The University of Hong Kong. 


All right, 
Thank you very much for considering my application.
I sincerely hope to be able to contribute to the university as an assistant professor of health economics, policy and management. 
Thank you very much. Any comments are welcome.
