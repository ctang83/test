<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Why move to AUstralia？
<ul>
<li>I moved to Australia for a number of reasons: the first is that my family wish to raise Jonny and Amy, my two kids, as bilingual children; the second is I applied and was granted Australian global talent visa last year;</li>
<li>so I wish to establish my new career around this place</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Why left GUangzhou Uni？
<ul>
<li>My family moved to Australia last November, when the lockdown was lifted. We initially plan to visit MQ, after the arrival, my family decided to stay here because my two kids enjoyed their new school, and because of the recent lockdown in China.</li>
<li>Recently, I moved on to work as a research fellow at MUCHE - …, however it is a short-term contract with one-year period, this is a transitional position for me</li>

<li>As one of post-USSR countries, its education system needs transformation, in particularly for the Medical Education system.</li>

<li>I have broad research interests, my primary research interest is in examining human resources for health. In particular, my research concerns the way in which a developing country accumulating physician human capital. Specifically, my projects ask questions such as:</li>
<li>I first raised the research question whether there is multi-tiered medical education system in China? If so, what are the long-term cost-benefits in implementing such an education and health system?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>What is the important contribution of your research? Why is [specific phenomenon I research] important?
<ul>
<li>my previous studies also detected the growth of private hospitals and their health workforce in China,</li>

<p><strong>Speech draft</strong></p>
<p>Good afternoon, everyone. I am honored to be here today to speak to you about my research in the field of public policy.</p>
<p>As an associate professor in this field, my work focuses on examining the intersection of policy and politics. I am particularly interested in how policy decisions are made and how they impact the lives of ordinary people.</p>
<p>Over the last several years, I have conducted research on a range of topics including campaign finance, healthcare policy, and education reform. One of my key contributions to the field has been to use quantitative methods to study the effects of policy on a wide range of outcomes, including economic growth, health outcomes, and educational achievement.</p>
<p>In my most recent work, I have focused on the impact of campaign finance on political polarization. My findings suggest that the increasing role of money in politics has led to a more divided political landscape, with politicians becoming more entrenched in their positions and less willing to compromise.</p>
<p>In addition to my research, I am also committed to teaching and mentoring students. I have taught a variety of courses at the undergraduate and graduate levels, including introductory courses on public policy and more specialized seminars on campaign finance and healthcare policy. I am passionate about helping students develop the skills and knowledge they need to succeed in the field of public policy.</p>
<p>I am excited to continue this line of research and to contribute to the growing body of knowledge on the effects of public policy on society. Thank you for the opportunity to speak with you today. I would be happy to take any questions you may have.</p>
