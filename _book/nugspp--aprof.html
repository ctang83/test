<p>A job talk for an associate professor in public policy might begin with an introduction to the candidate’s research interests and accomplishments. For example, the candidate could discuss their expertise in a specific area of public policy, such as education policy, health policy, or environmental policy. They could also discuss the research methods they use, such as quantitative analysis, qualitative interviews, or case studies.</p>
<p>Next, the candidate could provide examples of their published work and any grants or awards they have received. This could include discussing specific papers they have published in academic journals, as well as any books or book chapters they have written. The candidate could also discuss any grants they have received to support their research, as well as any awards they have received for their work.</p>
<p>The candidate could then discuss their teaching experience, including the courses they have taught and any innovative teaching methods they have developed. This could include discussing the specific topics covered in their courses, as well as any unique approaches or techniques they use to engage and motivate their students. The candidate could also discuss any relevant teaching experience outside of the classroom, such as leading study abroad programs or mentoring undergraduate research projects.</p>
<p>The presentation could conclude with a discussion of the candidate’s vision for their future research and teaching in the field of public policy. This could include discussing any specific research projects or initiatives they plan to pursue, as well as their goals for engaging with the broader public policy community.

<p><strong>Speech draft</strong></p>
<p>Good afternoon, everyone. I am honored to be here today to speak to you about my research in the field of public policy.</p>
<p>As an associate professor in this field, my work focuses on examining the intersection of policy and politics. I am particularly interested in how policy decisions are made and how they impact the lives of ordinary people.</p>
<p>Over the last several years, I have conducted research on a range of topics including campaign finance, healthcare policy, and education reform. One of my key contributions to the field has been to use quantitative methods to study the effects of policy on a wide range of outcomes, including economic growth, health outcomes, and educational achievement.</p>
<p>In my most recent work, I have focused on the impact of campaign finance on political polarization. My findings suggest that the increasing role of money in politics has led to a more divided political landscape, with politicians becoming more entrenched in their positions and less willing to compromise.</p>
<p>In addition to my research, I am also committed to teaching and mentoring students. I have taught a variety of courses at the undergraduate and graduate levels, including introductory courses on public policy and more specialized seminars on campaign finance and healthcare policy. I am passionate about helping students develop the skills and knowledge they need to succeed in the field of public policy.</p>
<p>I am excited to continue this line of research and to contribute to the growing body of knowledge on the effects of public policy on society. Thank you for the opportunity to speak with you today. I would be happy to take any questions you may have.</p>
