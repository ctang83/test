<p><strong>Story/career pathway</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Why move to AUstralia？
<ul>
<li>I moved to Australia for a number of reasons: the first is that my family wish to raise Jonny and Amy, my two kids, as bilingual children; the second is I applied and was granted Australian global talent visa last year;</li>
<li>so I wish to establish my new career around this place</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Why left GUangzhou Uni？
<ul>
<li>My family moved to Australia last November, when the lockdown was lifted. We initially plan to visit MQ, after the arrival, my family decided to stay here because my two kids enjoyed their new school, and because of the recent lockdown in China.</li>
<li>Recently, I moved on to work as a research fellow at MUCHE - …, however it is a short-term contract with one-year period, this is a transitional position for me</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Why NU?
<ul>
<li>My previous research focuses on health system and policy in China，while I have strong interests in developing countries, especially post-communist countries and their health system reform.</li>
<li>As one of post-USSR countries, its education system needs transformation, in particularly for the Medical Education system.</li>
<li>highly interested in the current democratic transition in Kazakhstan</li>
</ul></li>

<p><strong>Research</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Tell us about your research.
<ul>
<li>I have an academic background combined a Ph.D. in Economics from the University of New South Wales and a Master’s degree in Social Medicine &amp; Health Administration from a Medical University. My undergraduate training focus on the Food Science and Engineering, with a double-bachelor degree in Business Administration.</li>
<li>Over last decade, I have been working as a researcher and university faculty. In terms of research and analytical outcomes, I have authored a number of peer-reviewed publications and abstracts for conferences, such as HSR and iHEA.</li>
<li>I like utilising novel techniques in studying health system, I am among the first group who brought about network science approach to analyse health service delivery, and characterising dynamics of a health system, I have published papers in this interdisciplinary field</li>
<li>I have broad research interests, my primary research interest is in examining human resources for health. In particular, my research concerns the way in which a developing country accumulating physician human capital. Specifically, my projects ask questions such as:</li>
<li>I first raised the research question whether there is multi-tiered medical education system in China? If so, what are the long-term cost-benefits in implementing such an education and health system?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>What is the important contribution of your research? Why is [specific phenomenon I research] important?
<ul>
<li>my previous studies also detected the growth of private hospitals and their health workforce in China,</li>
<li>With expertise and knowledge in medical education and health workforce, I will propose a solution in strengthening health system in developing countries: accumulation of physician human capital<br />
</li>
<li>I am an advocate for workflow integration and automation, I use GitHub, Online Dashboard, and markdown, I will join World Bank GitHub group using a coding-style management</li>
<li>I am a Chinese native speaker, familiar with China’s experience and development
<ul>
<li>Chinese government prefer top-down approach, generally overlook the bottom-up approach</li>
<li>lack of qualified primary care system, hospital-dominance health system, which is closely related to the multi-tiered medical education system which I have studied and published</li>
<li>it’s sometimes even worse to build an unsatisfied primary care system, which resulted in coordination issues</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>What are your research plans?</li>
<li>Why are you interested in this job?
<ul>
<li><em>A trick is adding a line to pick their interest. Something along these lines: “I would also see myself creating a research group on X. If you are interested, I could elaborate on this”</em></li>
<li>As a researcher in health systems, I prefer real-world experience, however I have experience in just a few countries, such as China and Australia, I eager to get more working experience with different countries</li>
<li>I hope to gain more experiences in international comparison for health systems, which will benefit my research career in long-term.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>What funding would you apply for research?
<ul>
<li>they are asking about how to bring in money, which gives you a hint that they don’t have a lot of money there</li>
</ul></li>

<p><strong>Course</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>What courses would you teach in the [specific field] program that would meaningfully complement that program?</li>

<li>How would you teach a translation course at the undergraduate and graduate levels? What pedagogical approach do you have in your classes at the undergraduate and graduate levels?

<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.2</span> Job Talk Example<a href="nugspp--aprof.html#job-talk-example" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>A job talk for an associate professor in public policy might begin with an introduction to the candidate’s research interests and accomplishments. For example, the candidate could discuss their expertise in a specific area of public policy, such as education policy, health policy, or environmental policy. They could also discuss the research methods they use, such as quantitative analysis, qualitative interviews, or case studies.</p>
<p>Next, the candidate could provide examples of their published work and any grants or awards they have received. This could include discussing specific papers they have published in academic journals, as well as any books or book chapters they have written. The candidate could also discuss any grants they have received to support their research, as well as any awards they have received for their work.</p>
<p>The candidate could then discuss their teaching experience, including the courses they have taught and any innovative teaching methods they have developed. This could include discussing the specific topics covered in their courses, as well as any unique approaches or techniques they use to engage and motivate their students. The candidate could also discuss any relevant teaching experience outside of the classroom, such as leading study abroad programs or mentoring undergraduate research projects.</p>
<p>The presentation could conclude with a discussion of the candidate’s vision for their future research and teaching in the field of public policy. This could include discussing any specific research projects or initiatives they plan to pursue, as well as their goals for engaging with the broader public policy community.

<p><strong>Speech draft</strong></p>
<p>Good afternoon, everyone. I am honored to be here today to speak to you about my research in the field of public policy.</p>
<p>As an associate professor in this field, my work focuses on examining the intersection of policy and politics. I am particularly interested in how policy decisions are made and how they impact the lives of ordinary people.</p>
<p>Over the last several years, I have conducted research on a range of topics including campaign finance, healthcare policy, and education reform. One of my key contributions to the field has been to use quantitative methods to study the effects of policy on a wide range of outcomes, including economic growth, health outcomes, and educational achievement.</p>
<p>In my most recent work, I have focused on the impact of campaign finance on political polarization. My findings suggest that the increasing role of money in politics has led to a more divided political landscape, with politicians becoming more entrenched in their positions and less willing to compromise.</p>
<p>In addition to my research, I am also committed to teaching and mentoring students. I have taught a variety of courses at the undergraduate and graduate levels, including introductory courses on public policy and more specialized seminars on campaign finance and healthcare policy. I am passionate about helping students develop the skills and knowledge they need to succeed in the field of public policy.</p>
<p>I am excited to continue this line of research and to contribute to the growing body of knowledge on the effects of public policy on society. Thank you for the opportunity to speak with you today. I would be happy to take any questions you may have.</p>
