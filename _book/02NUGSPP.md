   **Speech draft**

Good afternoon, everyone. I am honored to be here today to speak to you about my research in the field of public policy.

As an associate professor in this field, my work focuses on examining the intersection of policy and politics. I am particularly interested in how policy decisions are made and how they impact the lives of ordinary people.

Over the last several years, I have conducted research on a range of topics including campaign finance, healthcare policy, and education reform. One of my key contributions to the field has been to use quantitative methods to study the effects of policy on a wide range of outcomes, including economic growth, health outcomes, and educational achievement.

In my most recent work, I have focused on the impact of campaign finance on political polarization. My findings suggest that the increasing role of money in politics has led to a more divided political landscape, with politicians becoming more entrenched in their positions and less willing to compromise.

In addition to my research, I am also committed to teaching and mentoring students. I have taught a variety of courses at the undergraduate and graduate levels, including introductory courses on public policy and more specialized seminars on campaign finance and healthcare policy. I am passionate about helping students develop the skills and knowledge they need to succeed in the field of public policy.

I am excited to continue this line of research and to contribute to the growing body of knowledge on the effects of public policy on society. Thank you for the opportunity to speak with you today. I would be happy to take any questions you may have.
